                    <p class="headline__text">Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes
                        we are unsure about
                        how to get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to
                        build a Figma plugin for the larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter

                        from plain, casual to playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our
                        Medium blog post, â€˜Designing voice and tone for error messages.</p>
